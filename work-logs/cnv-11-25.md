The given dataset is already in a structured format, so the process won't be that hard. My chosen strategy is extracted all the entity and then build the relationship between those enity.
There are two possible way for me to do this
1. Using Nxchat API, which I don't think it's ideal because without building the agentic pipeline then it only support seperate chunk 
2. Using copilot, since the copilot already support agent my jobs is define a good enough prompt and let it handles

So i go with the second option and do it with eahc module stating with ctc-data-en/contract-list and the extraction Results for contract-list:
